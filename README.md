## Introduction
This is a simple, saas ready fleet control reporting and dashboard frontend component. This can be used along with the backend component [(github link)](https://github.com/oldcrux/fleetcontrol_server) for a full application experience.

This application can be connected to a fleet of vehicles telematics devices via tcp connection and pulls the vehicle data from the backend application every 10secs to show the live status on the google map.

3. Vendor onboarding. A vendor can be a contractor with a fleet of vehicles. A fleet can belong to a main organization or a vendor.

4. Create geofences and assign a group of geofences to a vehicle.  Alternatively, geofences can also be bulk created via a json file. More details like schedule arrival, halt duration at a location can be provided in the json file.

Note - only circle geofences are supported.

sample bulk create geofences payload - 
```
[
    {
        
        "geofenceType": "circle",
        "tag": "Location1",
        "radius": 30,
        "center": {"lat":20.311,"lng":85.8568},
        "geofenceLocationGroupName": "LocationGroup1",
        "scheduleArrival": "06:38:00",
        "haltDuration": 17,
        "orgId": "org1",
        "createdBy": "org1admin"
    },
    {
        
        "geofenceType": "circle",
        "tag": "Location2",
        "radius": 30,
        "center": {"lat":20.3096,"lng":85.8599},
        "geofenceLocationGroupName": "LocationGroup1",
        "scheduleArrival": "07:51:00",
        "haltDuration": 3,
        "orgId": "org1",
        "createdBy": "org1admin"
    },
    {
        
        "geofenceType": "circle",
        "tag": "Location3",
        "radius": 30,
        "center": {"lat":20.3082,"lng":85.8605},
        "geofenceLocationGroupName": "LocationGroup1",
        "scheduleArrival": "08:33:00",
        "haltDuration": 2,
        "orgId": "org1",
        "createdBy": "org1admin"
    }
]
```

5. Vehicle onboarding and tracking. A vehicle can either be created in the UI or bulk created via a json file.

sample bulk create vehicles payload - 
```
[
  {
    "vehicleNumber": "ABCDE001",
    "make": "dummy",
    "model": "dummy",
    "owner": "Org1",
    "primaryPhoneNumber": "1234567890",
    "secondaryPhoneNumber": "",
    "serialNumber": "220717190",
    "vehicleGroup": "",
    "geofenceLocationGroupName": "",
    "orgId": "Org1",
    "createdBy": "org1admin"
  },
  {
    "vehicleNumber": "ABCDE002",
    "make": "dummy",
    "model": "dummy",
    "owner": "Org1",
    "primaryPhoneNumber": "1234567891",
    "secondaryPhoneNumber": "",
    "serialNumber": "220717191",
    "vehicleGroup": "",
    "geofenceLocationGroupName": "",
    "orgId": "Org1",
    "createdBy": "org1admin"
  }
]
```

6. Generate on-demand vehicle telemetry reports for the day with data like, total running time, total idle duration, geofences covered, time spent any assigned geofence location etc.

    Note - Vehicle reports are generated only if the vehicle is assigned with a geofence location group.

7. Geofence accuracy - This is a configurable number by which geohashing precision is calculated and determined whether a vehicle has traveled to an assigned geofence location. This can be configured at each Org level and defaulted to 30 meters.
8. Vehicle arrival window - A configurable time window, lets say 15mins to determine whether a vehicle has arrived an assigned location on time or not.
7. Email reports in xls format.


### Authentication
The application has a basic auth setup and the APIs are protected behind a middleware, which validates the auth token, before letting API access.

#### Google OAuth Setup Guide

To enable Google OAuth in your application, follow the steps below:

- üìÑ [Google OAuth Documentation](https://developers.google.com/identity/protocols/oauth2)  
  Review the official Google documentation for understanding OAuth 2.0 implementation.

- ‚öôÔ∏è [Google OAuth Configuration](https://console.developers.google.com/apis/credentials)  
  Visit the Google Developer Console to create and manage your OAuth client credentials.

This setup should be done on the frontend application, and the same ```GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID, GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET``` must be maintained here.

### Prerequisite
1. Docker demon
2. Node
3. npm
4. Google Map API key. You need a google map api key to use google maps. Follow the documentation given [here](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/get-api-key)


### .env file template
```
NEXT_PUBLIC_GOOGLE_MAP_API_KEY=
NEXT_PUBLIC_NODE_SERVER_URL=http://localhost:8080

# This is sample AUTH_SECRET value. Make sure to change it for your application. This key must be same across your frontend and backend server app. Here is an app where you can generate a random secret - https://auth-secret-gen.vercel.app/
AUTH_SECRET=bb9u0srGafGVy5smDOkRZTtD0i74XOS5q45rTkinsRc=

AUTH_MAX_AGE=14400    #, // 4 hours
AUTH_UPDATE_AGE=36000     #10 * 60 * 60 // 10 hours

# GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID and GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET are required for google oauth setup. Follow the documentation given above
GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=
GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET=

```

### Application setup and Running
Before you begin using this frontend application, you need to have a backend application running. Follow the instructions in the [(github link)](https://github.com/oldcrux/nodeserver). Then execute below command to start the application in local - 

```
npm install
npm run dev
```

### Docker build and push
```
docker build --no-cache --platform linux/amd64 -t <your repo> .
docker push <your repo>
```
